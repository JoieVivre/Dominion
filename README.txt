Overall this java program is supposed to mimic the deck building game "Dominion" by Rio Grande Games.
DominionGameCenter main method will launch the play method in Dominion. Right now it is coded to only accept 2 players.  

The game is currently only coded for "First Game" of Dominion. The Supply for this game includes 10 Kingdom decks with only 8 cards each 
(as opposed to the regular 10). Descriptions of the Action cards are not provided until after a card is played.

There is some error checking for user input: if you're actually interested in finishing a game, be careful on how you spell Deck names.
Currently, there is no error checking for cheating.

Card and deck classes are based off of Card and Deck classes described at this link: http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c5/s4.html
